title: First (introductory) session this week
---

The first ATRAP session will be held this week, on Thursday, October
18th at 18:00. I'm not sure if this is a stable time for the future, but since
the first session won't consist of much more than an overview of plans for the
reading groups and an introduction to the first text, it should not take long.

Apart form formalities, there are three things to cover:

1. Why read? Why care about history? A few words about why this reading group
   exist.
2. I'll go attempt to justify the principles as they are currently written,
   probably realise that something is wrong or missing which will be added and
   changed later. Then, we'll go over the proposed curriculum, again justifying
   the choices and explaining what to expect from each one. This one might be a
   little more difficult since some of the choices are very idiosyncratic, so
   hopefully we can modify it according to demand with a bit of discussion.
3. An introduction to the first text.

The first session is abnormal, as future ones will only be concerned with
debate and an introduction of the future text.

As of this writing, the curriculum is incomplete, it should be mostly done by
the first meeting. Even if not, it will still be possible to discuss what will
topics will be covered.
