Let's start the new cycle with a bit of a bang.

Quite frequently, one hears Le Corbusier or Gropius being referred to as
«hardcore» functionalism. To convince you that's probably not the case, I'll
use the quote below to make the point:

> The ideal of this most modern "human type" is more likely than not a house or
> apartment resembling historical replicas of the Petit Trianon, the
> Belvedere, Venice, or Neuremberg: of course, once the taste of such a modern
> builder has become really "modernised", it then becomes acceptable to build
> in place of the Trianon Le Corbusier's Villa Garches or Villa Poissy, or
> Loos's Villa in Prague, or Mallet-Stevens's Villa in Paris, While Mies van
> der Rohe builds as the pinnacle of modernist snobbish and the ostentation of
> a millionaire's lifestyle a villa for the factory owner T. in B. All these
> houses with all their technical luxury and radical design devices, with all
> their formal originality, are really nothing other than new versions of
> opulent baroque palaces, that is, seats of the new financial aristocracy. A
> machine for living? No, a machine for representation and splendour, for the
> idle, lazy life of the bosses playing golf and their ladies bored in their
> boudoirs.

Those are some of the introductory words in Karel Teige's _The Minimum
Dwelling_, an extract of which we will be reading for Thursday.

For those unfamiliar with the thinker, the [wikipedia
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Teige) is quite good. Suffice it to
say that you will have a hard time finding somebody more critical and radical
during all our readings.

As the title of the book that the text is an extract from, the subject matter
is Teige's analysis of what constitutes a minimum dwelling, which was a topic
pertinent at the time of his writing (1932) as CIRPAC designated it as one of
the issues to address and solve.

As we live in Prague, it would be a big mistake to avoid Teige or be unaware of
him. Although he was most certainly not an architect, he was, for a while,
possibly the most important person in the Czech architectural scene. The
Minimum Dwelling won't help you understand a building directly, but it will
help you understand the mindset that was in the air when functionalism was not
a historical reference.

See you Thursday.
