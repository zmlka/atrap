First things first, thanks to those that attended Thursday's, if I may say so
myself, excellent session. The second reading is not as ambitious in terms of
page count as last weeks, but comes with it's own challenge: the talk is being
held in Venice since many of us are attending the Biennale. For those who can
not make it but still want to discuss Loos's work, we can have a make up
session on Monday, 5th November. For those that will be in Venice, we can, and
should, also extend the session to more than one and discuss the Biennale in a
slightly-more-than-casual manner.

For this week, we are reading Loos's classic *Ornament and Crime* from 1908. As
before, it can be found in .pdf on the dropbox. There are some things that might
be worth noting:

* Some years prior to writing *Ornament and Crime*, Loos had travelled to the
  USA where he encountered the work of, amongst others, Sullivan and Wright.
  Their writings and styles informed him and his opinions, and hence what he
  wrote about upon his return to Europe.
* At the time of writing, the Viennese Secession was still in recent memory,
  and the Werkbund was just starting up. Look had strong opinions on both of
  these.
* At the time of writing, Loos had done very little design, and that which he
  did was intriors.
* We are in Prague. If you have not done so, go visit the [Villa
  MÃ¼ller](http://www.mullerovavila.cz/?q=english). The picture above is of it.

As a side note, the first request for a specific topic to cover some of these
sessions has come about, which is great. I'll incorporate the Garden City
Movement in by cutting some other topic.

Lastly, as promised I have made an attempt to write up some of what was
floating in the air at the end of last Tuesday's AD crit: [Personal-Impersonal
Contextual-Universal. Or, An Attempt to Understand Biographical
Design](http://zmlka.com/personal_impersonal_contextual_universal).
I can not vouch for intelligibility.
