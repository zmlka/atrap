We took a breather from LC, but he's back for more, a full two years after his
treatise on architecture in the form of Towards An Architecture, urbanism is
next in the line with The City of To-Morrow and Its Planning.

Urbanism seems to be a popular word within the hall of ARCHIP these days, and
I expect that some of you are already familiar with the text, all the better.
It's difficult to formulate the status that this book has in words, so I will
resort to quoting the copy at found on the back of my version of the book:

> [I]t is a revered work that, quite literally, helped shape our world ... The
> influence it exerted on a new generation of architects is now legendary.
>
> ...
>
> For those who live in cities as well as anyone interested in their planning,
> here is a probing survey of the problems of modern urban life and a master
> architect's stimulating vision of how they might be solved, enlivened by the
> innovative spirit and associate creativity that distinguished all of Le
> Corbusier's work.

To which I can only add that, this text is one of the crucial ones to be
familiar with in order to understand the situation of many European cities, as
most underwent some transformation informed by Corbusier's thinking, and for
understanding the thinking that might be fuelling the current style of building
in the pop-up cities, especially in Asia.

The reading consists of two chapters at the very beginning of the book dealing
with some principles, and a chapter from the very end dealing with a concrete
proposal for Paris (the famous Plan Voisin).
