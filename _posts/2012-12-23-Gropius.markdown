A long break, a long text. The New Architecture and the Bauhaus, originally
written in German in 1925, the last year that the Bauhaus was in Dessau and
towards the end of Gropius's directorship of it, is a text that explains the
philosophy that Gropius infused into the school, and thereby the philosophy
under which he thought.

As with many of the other figures that we have read so far, Gropius hardly
needs an introduction, and if he does than just skim his wikipedia article.
What is important to pick out is how he forms a part of the general narrative
that was taking place in Europe during inter-war period, and recognise that it
is perhaps his notions of how to build for the future that are the most widely
understood under the term "modernism".

The text is the longest that will ever be presented, so read as much as you
want it at your own leisure. If there is any one key passage to read, it would
be the last few paragraphs, starting with "To sum up:" on page 21. The entire
book is available (without pictures, which makes some of the passages about
light between buildings more cryptic than necessary). 

If you have 27 minutes to watch a preparatory video, [here is a great
one](http://youtu.be/u-IVejSt3BI) about the architecture of the Bauhaus
building.

We meet next on the 3rd of January.
