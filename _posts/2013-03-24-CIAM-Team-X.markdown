By this stage, we have all probably had enough of Modernism, and have all
gotten quite good at criticising it. Let us then, have this one session that
will deal with the era and mindset of Modernism as a sort of swan song for it.
We shall read what is perhaps the most famous document of CIAM, the Athens
Charter, and begin to look into responses to it.

The Charter was written by that ever present looming figure, Le Corbusier
sometime in the early 30's and presented at the CIAM meeting of 1933. It is
quite a long document, and one does not need to go reading all the fine
details, it should be enough to read the headings of the 95 points raised.
The rhetoric will be familiar, but what will perhaps not be familiar are the
manners in which CIAMs principles were criticised within their own time by a
younger generation of architects.

Team X, pronounced “team ten”, was something of a rebellious movement launched
from within CIAM itself, by younger members of the meetings. Spearheaded by
personalities which are by the present day, household names within those aware
of architecture (Jacob Bakema, Aldo van Eyck, the Smithons), Team X went on
to have a long existence of exchanging ideas and moving the discipline further.
The history of Team X is not easy to recapitulate in a few sentences, but we'll
cover it in person on Thursday.


As for the reading, we will read the Statement on Habitat (also known as the
Doorn Manifesto), one of the very few documents that was procuded by Team X, as
the ethos of the group was to develop ideas through discussing projects. Even
the statement is not much of a statement, but more of a series of notes written
by the Smithsons that give some of the reasons for their disagreement with the
CIAM approach to urbanism and architecture.

As there is plenty of time till the next session (there will be no ATRAP on the
28th due to Easter Vacations), some additional reading might be added.
