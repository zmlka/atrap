title: 2.00 - ATRAP returning 12.March 2013!

This Thursday, there will be no ATRAP. Time is still needed to put together the
readings for the next weeks on the basis of some of what was mentioned during
the last session, and as you can see in the picture above it will be a bit of a
messy process.

The aim will be to have 20 or so texts which will then provide us with
something to look forward to for the next two semesters, since, as usual, there
will be cancellations every now and then, and we'll read requests as they come
in or are relevant.

To remind you, last thing we read was Gropius, and we will be starting the
second cycle with the last breaths of Modernism, after which you should
experience a radical flurry of fresh thoughts in all that followed. Things will
get messy and the readings even more convoluted, and hence more enjoyable.
