In the making of the image above, my phone has vibrated a dozen times, I've
pressed command-tab uncountable times, watched youtube in Firefox and Vimeo in
Safari, saved some images, talked with friends and family.

Time is short: the time before ticking Thursday[^1], the time we all seem to have.
We are in need of bite sized snippets of genius, and if not that then candied
pop culture might just be enough to please our appetite. ARCHIGRAM should
please both camps.

It would be a shock if somebody has not seen images of [the walking
city](http://images.lmgtfy.com/?q=the+walking+city) or other things the group
has produced. Yet that's about as far as most appreciations of ARCHIGRAM go:
the visual; and yet still these phantasmagoric pictures have something behind
them, some sort of message that is deeply about architecture, be that about the
practice or the institution. 

ARCHIGRAM should be both an antidote and a complete break from the serious
tone that we have been using till now. That's not to say it's not serious,
quite the opposite –  this was the 60's after all.

There are two issues of ARCHIGRAM's publications on the ATRAP dropbox, we
should at least be able to manage to «read» the four page comic in issue number
four……

[^1]: This talk about time should not make you think that ATRAP will start late. 17:30 *sharp*.
