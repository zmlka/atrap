## Curriculum

This page is most difficult part, and is still incomplete.

Perhaps curriculum is too strong a word, but if the word ‘schedule’ was applied
it might be even more dangerous. Curriculum suggests a list of topics to cover,
which is looser than ‘schedule’ which actually states the manner and times in
which it will be done. By design, I have factored in a natural ambiguity into
the general curriculum by listing the topics to cover by not specific texts,in order
to allow for dynamic changes texts, and to allow the readings to not be the
same the any two consecutive years.

The decision has been made to split the ATRAP reading/discussion list into two,
corresponding with two school terms, and roughly with the first and second
halves of the 20th century. The first half ending sometime in the glory of
CIAM, and the second ending on the verge of the 80s and 90s, with a sneak peek
into the present.

Last but not least, the selection is quite idiosyncratic and hence should and
will be changed according to demand.

## The General Curriculum

### 1/2

1. The Chicago World Fair and its critics
    * We start at the turn of the century, but not in fin de siècle Europe but
      in **Chcaigo**, where, with the «crime» of the World's Fair still in memory
      serving as a reference point of terrible, an architecure scene emerges.
    * It's quite a nice starting place for looking at 20th century
      architecture, since the themes that were disucssed never left us.
1. Gesamtkunstwerk
    * Half way across the globe, **Adolf Loos** reacts to a different
      exhibition, the Jubilee Exhibition for Franz Josef's 50th anniversary.
    * Loos is an oft-misunderstood writer and architect, and reading a his
      texts goes far into avoiding such a misunderstanding.
1. Except in struggle, there is no more beauty.
    * And so we come across the first of many «radical» groups.
    * We look at **Constructivism** for both its significance at the time, and
      its lastig staypower with its ability to influence genrations of
      architects. But what is the reality of the thoughts behind the fancy
      visuals?
1. Many faces
    * As a reading group set in Prague, it is justifiable to spend time looking
      at **Cubist** architecture.
    * We look at what cubism is and its origins in painting, and how successful
      its transition into architecture was.
1. Dada means nothing and we declare an uncompromising war on art
    * Two radical art movements, **Dada** and **Futurism**, while not directly
      related to architecrue have had such lasting influence on culture in
      general that it is worth it to cover them.
    * While extreme examples, they provide us with some context to the social
      and artistic scene in Europe at the time, and by extent might help
      explain some of the past and future study matter.
1. Eyes that do not see
    * **Le Corbusier**, a household name, the face of the Swiss 10 Franc bill,
      an prolific architect and a busy writer.
    * To what degree he followed his own words and how many phases of his life
      we can identify is a question that probably can't be answered, but it can
      be ivnestigated.
1. Less is more
    * **Mies van der Rohe**. In keeping with the dictum above, not more to be
      said.
1. We are returning to honesty of thought and feeling
    * A fellow expatriate, **Walter Gropius** is another often blamed and
      frequently misunderstood figure.
    * We might have heard what he has to say before, but 30 years makes a
      difference.
1. The world, smiling
    * This, and the entry below are dedicated to the rather hardcore branch of
      **Czech Functinalism** that centred around the thinker Karel Teige.
    * The men who called Le Corbusier too soft helped shape the atmosphere we
      live in in Prague.
1. The world, scented
    * As above. It is worth it to spend two sessions on this topic.
1. SS Patris
    * We culminate somewhere in the Mediterranean, en route from Athens to
      Marseilles.
    * In some ways, **CIAM** a summary of some of the things
      covered in the preceeding ten weeks, in many ways, the thing that the
      next 20 years somehow reacted to.


### 2/2

1. "What do you want Brick?"
    * Look on any top 10 architectural personality popularity list, and  **Louis
      Kahn** is probably somewhere somewhere in there.
    * As with many of the architects who write, lecture and teach prolifically,
      he cared deeply about the profession and had his own brand of it.
      In his case, there are certain words that we will come across that he has
      managed to appropriate.
1. The Doorn Manifesto
    * Not all was well by the time CIAM had it's ninth meeting in
      Aix-en-Provence, and a few years later at the tenth we get the formal
      emergence of **Team Ten** (also known as Team X or Team 10).
    * And so begins the attempted dismantling of CIAM from within.
1. The walking city
    * One often hears of the stark difference between architecture school and
      reality.
    * Not so for **Archigram**, who unleashed the playfulness of school
      projects outside of it while employing wit and irony to engage in
      Critique.
1. Flood of the Arno River
    * The very real flooding of the Arno River in 1966 was also a great
      symbolic act and awakening call for Florentines. The rampant destruction
      of the heritage of the city was unprecedented.
    * Two linked groups of architects/designers emerged around this period:
      **SUPERSTUDIO** and **ARCHIZOOM**. All caps intended.
1. The spectacle
    * The society. The previous few weeks have put us in top gear top ready to
      handle 1968 France.
    * **The Situationist International**. Propagators of psychogeography,
      interpretares of space and its opression.
1. Clusters in the Air
    * Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a Japan is a country still
      recovering from Word War II and looking for a revival.
    * The **Metabolists** are perhaps he most tightly knit research and
      intellectual architectural movement of the 20the century. Somwhat
      mysterious and always exotic.
1. I am a monument
    * By this stage, our pace is significantly picking up and we have to pick
      our subjects carefully. however, there is one thing that can't be missed.
    * Two texts that heralded forward the aesthetics era of post-modernism by
      **Robert Venturi** and **Denise Scott Brown**.
1. Five on Five Architects
    * Some were not satisfied to have been broken free of the shackles of the
      internatinal style and modernity in general. Some still do prefer white
      washed walls.
    * The debate between the so called **Grays** and **Whites** is an
      interesting document to look at, because it so symptomatic of the
      architectural discurse at the time. The names involved are still houshold
      names (in architectural household) today.
1. Into the void inside out
    * Architecture is not an island, and if one needs a perfect example it
      would be this. The interaciton between **Peter Eisenman** and Jacques
      Derrida led to a huge shift in the possibility of what architecture could
      be.
    * Linguistic analysis leads to deconstruction and critique.
1. Beyond a certain critical mass, a building becomes a BIG Building
    * Jumping years ahead again, an architect begins to face broader and
      broader issues. No longer is one building being considered, but sometimes
      the fate of an entire continet.
    * If three is an architect that can write, its **Rem Koolhaas**.
1. Czech architecture and its austerity
    * But maybe a country is an island, even if landlocked as is the case of
      the Czech Republic. How is it that there is such a strong prevalenc of a
      certain aesthatic within this nation? Are the spirits/ghosts of
      functionalism really that strong?
    * In the only non-primary source of the series, we look at a text by
      **Rostislav Svacha** that might explain the above.
1. The present, part 1
    * The current moment is split into two tracks. This session is abut those
      who fundementally believe the value of things (ie: what is important is
      the properties of things in themselves)
    * This is the tendency towards understanding.
    * **Phenomenology**, **Deconstruction**, **Linguistics**, and almost all
      other branches of architecture that attempt to understand what it is that
      they are dealing with.
1. The present, part 2
    * The current moment is split into two tracks. This session is abut those
      who fundementally believe in the value of connections (ie: what is
      important is the relationships between things).
    * This is the tendency towards complexity.
    * **Parametricism**, **Generative Design** and all branches of architecture
      that admit defeat over the possibility of knowing the world.
