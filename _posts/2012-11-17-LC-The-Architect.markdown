After a difficult session last week with a bit of non-architectural obscurity
(those damned artists!) we return to architectural big timers. Yes that's
right, we will read the man whose glorious round glasses adorn one of the most
aesthetically pleasing monetary bills in circulation today, Charles-Edouard
Jeanneret, commonly known as Le Corbusier.

As we could easily spend the rest of the year on LC, the texts selected are
for this week are those that are most famous, general and timely. You will
notice that the name of this session is Le Corbusier The Architect, indicating
that there is a concentration on that side of his oeuvre. We will have another
session which will concentrate on him as a town planner shortly.

The texts available on dropbox are:

- The introductory chapter from ‘Towards an Architecture’ by Le Corbusier. The
  introduction vaguely introduces all the concepts in the book in an almost
  poem-like fashion, which is quite good for our purposes, but also quite bad
  in that it is somewhat vague. Each of the headers in the introduction is then
  given full treatment in the form of a chapter in the book, so hopefully it
  will entice you to go on to read the full text.
- ‘Five Points on Architecture’ by Le Corbusier and Peirre Jeanneret. This, on
  the other hand, is precise. A recommendation: have pictures and plans of the
  Villa Savoye next to you as you read this.

On Thursday, I'll bring in one of LC's monographs that covers this period as
reference material to look through as well.

A side note on version of ‘Towards and Architecture’ that we are reading.
We are reading [the 1927 translation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/9650060367/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=9650060367&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21), but there has recently (2008) been [a new
translation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0711228094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0711228094&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21). 
According to Kenneth Frampton, the new translation is a more direct and factual
translation, while the old one better captures the poetics of the French
original. No pressure, but you should have one of them.


PS: if anybody is having trouble with the dropbox, please let me know.
