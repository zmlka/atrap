And so it begins. After our introductory session that consisted of little more
than a monologue it's time to see who will actually read. We meet on Thursday,
25th October, at 17:45 in the ARCHIP lecture room. Some cookies will be on
hand.

The reading for this weeks are two pieces, one rather short and one a little
longer:

* Louis Sullivan - The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered
* Frank Lloyd Wright - The Art and Craft of the Machine

Both can be found in .pdf format on Dropbox. I have noticed that many of those
that are receiving this newsletter have not yet accepted the invitation to
join the Dorpobox folder, which means you don't have access to the text. Please
join in as all readings will be posted there.  Should there be any problems
(want to use different email address, don't trust Dropbox, lost invitation,
etc), please let me know â€“ the last thing we want is for somebody to not be
able to read due to technical issues.

On a final note, I wrote up some of what I mentioned in the introductory
session as a mini essay on a separate site: [A brief justification of reading
(history)](http://zmlka.com/a_brief_justification_of_reading_history).
The only other things that were covered was the curriculum and principles,
which can be found on their respective sections on the main ATRAP site.
