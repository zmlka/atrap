The other giant. The one that didn't publish, yet he did talk. And he had
something to say. Mies van der Rohe is perhaps the most re-interpreted
architect of the 20th century, perhaps exactly because he, of all the «greats»
hardly wrote a thing.

Of the few things that are attributed to him, there is one that might be
considered something of a mini-manifesto, but taken on its own it is slightly
misleading and almost meaningless. Yet *Architecture and Technology*, written
in 1950 is perhaps the one simplest thing that you can point to to show how
different he was from all the other modernists. Before this turns into an essay
on how Mies is not only the most re-interpreted architect, but also the most
abused (in the sense that there are all sorts of claims made about his work),
go read the text for yourself.

To give a more complete picture, we are also reading a 1960 interview with him.

Two other important things to mention:

* **ATRAP IS NOT MEETING THIS THURSDAY**. Because the Jakub Cigler public
  lecture at ARCHIP starts at 18:00 this week, it does not make sense to only
  meet for half an hour. And, since there is a Christmas Party on Friday,
  moving the date forward is senseless too. Therefore, **ATRAP will take place at
  16:30 on Monday.**
* After Mies, we will be reading Gropius. I recommend you pick up a copy of
  [The New Architecture and the
  Bauhaus](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0262570068/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0262570068&linkCode=as2&tag=zmlka-21).
