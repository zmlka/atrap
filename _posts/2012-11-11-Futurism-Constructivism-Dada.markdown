This week is a bit of a challenge. For two reasons: The texts involved are from
rather «radical» groups, and the groups themselves were not manly concerned
with architecture. Looking over the agenda ahead of us, this might be the most
challenging discussion to have exactly for those reasons. The positions of the
groups are hard to identify with today with our 20/20 hindsight, and in order
to appreciate them it might be necessary to do some historical/contextual
analysis.

Although the texts are not strictly architectural, it is still important
reading for anybody. These groups were influential at their times, and still
continue to be referenced today - frequently without knowing exactly what they
were about. If anything, they show just how tremendously radically the times
were changing, and just how conservative we all look these days.

The texts are:

- ‘Constructivism’ - Two extracts from pamphlets published by the 1st Working
  Group of the Constructivists. Not directly related to architecture, and with
  it's gratuitous use of ALLCAPS and various typographic
  all-over-the-place-ness a disorientating read.
- ‘Dada Manifesto’ by Tristan Tzara. Dada is well known, and this is a
  surprisingly coherent piece of writing considering the usual output of the
  group.
- ‘Futurist Architecture’ by Antonio Sant’elia. Like the above, a bit of a
  surprise in it's tone. Initially, the idea was to read the original [Futurist
  Manifesto](http://masi.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/T4PM/futurist-manifesto.html),
  which is a good read and is much more «radical», but this one was picked for
  its direct relation to architecture.

All texts are on the ATRAP dropbox.

Each of the texts is something like seven pages long, so most likely we all
won't have time to read all of them, especially considering their complexity.
Pick one or two and, hopefully, different people will pick different ones.

Hope to see you all on Thursday.
