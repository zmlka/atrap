The Material Production of the Spiral Jetty: A Study of Culture in the Making.
Not your usual ATRAP subject matter, nor the usual subject matter of
Architecture Institutions. However, with Fernando Rubio giving a talk at
ARCHIP in a week (which I predict will be the best public event hosted at the
school so far), it might be good to get familiar with his investigations.

The text for this week is an extract form his essay published in Cultural
Sociology in 2012. We are reading a selection not because the original is
particularly long, but because it contains some rather sociology-specific
content that will probably not be of interest to the usual ARTRAP audience.
However, you can access the full version
[online](http://fdrubio.org/Resources/Cultural%20Sociology-2012-Rubio-143-61.pdf).
For the extract we are reading, please start at the heading.

The text presents the ins and outs of how one of the most famous pices of
landscape art in the world came into being, the [Spiral
Jetty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Jetty) by Robert Smithson.

It will be curious to hear what we make of the 'moral' and conclusions of the
story, if it is something that is already self-evident to us as architects in
training, or if we will disagree.

See you Thurday, 17:30. May there be sun.
