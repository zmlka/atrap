## Curriculum

This page is most difficult part, and is still incomplete.

Perhaps curriculum is too strong a word, but if the word ‘schedule’ was applied
it might be even more dangerous. Curriculum suggests a list of topics to cover,
which is looser than ‘schedule’ which actually states the manner and times in
which it will be done. By design, I have factored in a natural ambiguity into
the general curriculum by listing the topics to cover by not specific texts,in order
to allow for dynamic changes texts, and to allow the readings to not be the
same the any two consecutive years.

The decision has been made to split the ATRAP reading/discussion list into two,
corresponding with two school terms, and roughly with the first and second
halves of the 20th century. The first half ending sometime in the glory of
CIAM, and the second ending on the verge of the 80s and 90s, with a sneak peek
into the present.

Last but not least, the selection is quite idiosyncratic and hence should and
will be changed according to demand.

## The General Curriculum

### 1/2

1. The Chicago World Fair and its critics
    * We start at the turn of the century, but not in fin de siècle Europe but
      in **Chcaigo**, where, with the «crime» of the World's Fair still in memory
      serving as a reference point of terrible, an architecure scene emerges.
    * It's quite a nice starting place for looking at 20th century
      architecture, since the themes that were disucssed never left us.
1. Gesamtkunstwerk
    * Half way across the globe, **Adolf Loos** reacts to a different
      exhibition, the Jubilee Exhibition for Franz Josef's 50th anniversary.
    * Loos is an oft-misunderstood writer and architect, and reading a his
      texts goes far into avoiding such a misunderstanding.
1. Except in struggle, there is no more beauty.
    * And so we come across the first of many «radical» groups.
    * We look at **Constructivism** for both its significance at the time, and
      its lastig staypower with its ability to influence genrations of
      architects. But what is the reality of the thoughts behind the fancy
      visuals?
1. Many faces
    * As a reading group set in Prague, it is justifiable to spend time looking
      at **Cubist** architecture.
    * We look at what cubism is and its origins in painting, and how successful
      its transition into architecture was.
1. Dada means nothing and we declare an uncompromising war on art
    * Two radical art movements, **Dada** and **Futurism**, while not directly
      related to architecrue have had such lasting influence on culture in
      general that it is worth it to cover them.
    * While extreme examples, they provide us with some context to the social
      and artistic scene in Europe at the time, and by extent might help
      explain some of the past and future study matter.
1. Eyes that do not see
    * **Le Corbusier**, a household name, the face of the Swiss 10 Franc bill,
      an prolific architect and a busy writer.
    * To what degree he followed his own words and how many phases of his life
      we can identify is a question that probably can't be answered, but it can
      be ivnestigated.
1. Less is more
    * **Mies van der Rohe**. In keeping with the dictum above, I will mention
      no more.
1. We are returning to honesty of thought and feeling
    * A fellow expatriate, **Walter Gropius** is another often blamed and
      frequently misunderstood figure.
    * We might have heard what he has to say before, but 30 years makes a
      difference.
1. The world, smiling
    * This, and the entry below are dedicated to the rather hardcore branch of
      **Czech Functinalism** that centred around the thinker Karel Teige.
    * The men who called Le Corbusier too soft helped shape the atmosphere we
      live in in Prague.
1. The world, scented
    * As above. It is worth it to spend two sessions on this topic.
1. SS Patris
    * We culminate somewhere in the Mediterranean, en route from Athens to
      Marseilles.
    * In some ways, **CIAM** a summary of some of the things
      covered in the preceeding ten weeks, in many ways, the thing that the
      next 20 years somehow reacted to.
