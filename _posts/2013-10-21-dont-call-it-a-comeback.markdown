ATRAP on the return.

The summer is not upon us, and by definition that means that it's time for
ATRAP to resume it's activities, as has been no doubt eagerly anticipated.

So yes, ATRAP returns, with improvements based on current circumstances and
past learnings. A run-down:

- We will not only be reading texts. ATRAP recognises your absence of an
  attention span, the richness of mediums other than the written word, and the
  desire to learn cover more topics than just histheory that might not be
  covered in school curricula. Hence, this year, we will also be regularly
  dipping into the *audiovisual* and *non-textual*; movies and pictures,
  basically.
- Not on Thursdays. Currently, it seems that Friday afternoon will be the time
  to meet, but that might change.
- Currently looking for a better way to distribute the readings, Dropbox seems
  too difficult for some.

So much for the re introduction, on to the contents of the first session. Due
to new people (hopefully) joining, the programme for this year will be more
situational and less, hmm, chronological.

It should be enough to know that Vincent Scully wrote the introduction to this
book. Not only did he write it, but this is the firs phrase:

> This is not an easy book. It requires professional commitment and close
> visual attention, and is not for those architects who, lest they offend them,
> pluck out their eyes.

The book is **Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture**. Most likely the
single most important architecture publication in the past half century. Some
of you have probably read it, and those who haven't will (please?). For
Friday's session, we will be looking at the first few pages, which outline a
general standpoint for the whole book which then goes on to cite examples and
performs studies.

The only thing to add is, to those that were there and remember, what we
covered by looking at the first 50 years of the 20th century. The dogma and
purity that characters like Karel Teige and Mies van der Rohe were advocating
and practising.

Hope to see you, Friday, 25.10.2013, 16:15, lower studio space, ARCHIP. Then we
will also discuss some of the other fun stuff that is lined up in ATRAP, such
as the films and whatnot.
