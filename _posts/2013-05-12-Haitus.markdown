The summer is upon us (well, [not
officially](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer#Timing)). Another thing that is
upon ARCHIP is the not insignificant reality that soon, too soon, all sorts of
coursework is due to be handed in.

The combination of these two things has lead to two situations: one in the past
and one in the future. The past: in the past few weeks seems to be more in
demand to spend the remains of Thursdays at Letna, discussing anything but
books. The future: ATRAP will go on hiatus till next semester.

It has been a good first year of operation, I enjoyed it greatly and learned a
lot, and hope you have as well. The initial ambitious pace has slowed a bit,
but all the better as it gave us a more appropriate digestion period for the
various events in 20th century architecture history. Because there will be no
meetings on Thursdays, it does not imply that there will be no reading. I'll
add a ‘summer reading’ folder to dropbox where you can pick and chose.

Thanks for the year. ATRAP will return.
