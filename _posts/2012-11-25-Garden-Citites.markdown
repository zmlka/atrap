After the white-wash of Towards an Architecture, maybe it is time for a bit of
greenery. By popular demand, this week we will cover the Garden City Movement,
which is chronologically a bit of a step back (the text we are reading was
published in 1912), which is unfortunate.

On the upside, the ARCHIP public lecture that will take place immediately after
the book club is titled "Compact city vs Urban Sprawl - Density as a
Precondition of Creating High Quality Urban Places", which *might* set up a
nice contrast wit the text that we are reading, as it is titled "NOTHING GAINED BY
OVERCROWDING!".

This is also the first piece concentrating on urbanism/planning that we will be
reading, which is, I'm sure, a welcome change by some.

A final tip regarding reading the text. It assumes prior knowledge with the
overall idea of what Garden Cities are, as Unwin does not bother to explain
then and instead references the works of Ebenezer Howard, the founder of the
movement. I would recommend to at least read the first part of the the
[wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement) for
understanding what they are.
